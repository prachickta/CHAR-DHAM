# CHAR-DHAM
The Char Dham Yatra is a popular Hindu pilgrimage circuit in the Indian Himalayas comprising four sites: Yamunotri, Gangotri, amarnath kedarnath badrinath. The Char Dham is located in the state of Uttarakhand, India.
The best way to do the amarnath kedarnath badrinath Yatra is to plan your trip well in advance. You should make sure to book your tickets and accommodations well before your scheduled dates in order to avoid any last-minute surprises. Additionally, you should make sure to plan your route carefully, as both of these yatras require a lot of trekking and long distance hiking. You should also plan for rest and breaks in between, as well as consulting with local guides who can provide you with local knowledge and insight. Finally, you should make sure to carry the necessary gear, such as sturdy shoes, food and water, a first-aid kit, and warm clothing
